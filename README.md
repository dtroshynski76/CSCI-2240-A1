# CSCI-2240-A1
The first assignment for my Intro to C class

Assignment files coming soon.

Compiled with the gcc compiler version: gcc version 4.6.3 (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.6.3-1ubuntu5)

To compile: type `gcc <file-name>` and the resultant file should be named `a.out`; type `gcc <file-name> -o <out-file-name>` to name the resultant compiled file (will not have the ".out" filetype).

To run, type `./a.out` if compiled with the default name "a", otherwise `./<file-name>`.
